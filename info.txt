What is Hyperloop? section:
  - Hyperloop is a transportation system first introduced by Elon Musk that is composed of a vacuumed system of tubes, through which a pod may transport passengers or cargo.
  - The lack of friction and air resistance would in theory reduce travel time and create a very efficient transport system.

Why compete?:
  -Hyperloop is still a working concept. SpaceX's Hyperloop competition is meant to "accelerate the development of functional prototypes and encourage student innovation".
